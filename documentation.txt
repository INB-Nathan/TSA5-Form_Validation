Before programming the needed system, first identify what are the roles and ano ung mga needed na data from the user.

Since ung theme ng system ko is an online bakery shop, customer and admin ung needed na roles.

Ano mga pwedeng gawin ni customer? Login, view available items, and view their own profile
Si admin, login, view alist of registered users, and perform user maintenance, and CRUD operations on items

Data to be gathered from the user is:
Email, Username, Password. wala ng full name kasi di naman need ihandle ng system ko ung full name, it is just a online bakery shop not an student portal. This way ung system is compliant with data minimization by avoiding unnecessary fields upfront.

now lets start sa database muna, pano istrustructure ung tables and ano ung rows and primary keys/foreign keys.

three tables: user, customer, products, orders, order_items.

user is ung needed details para mag login, customer table is connected to the user since may instances na need ng name, phone no, and address for delivery.

products is the bakery items

orders is the customer orders, and order items is for normalizing order details, para ma avoid natin ung redudancy.
